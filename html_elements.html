    <p>In terms of HTML5 as well as language, semantics refers to word choice and meaning. In the world of webpages a number of names are used for elements. Elements are either semantic or non-semantic, with <div> noting a page divide but not what it contains. <Form> however defines it's content and is therefore semantic. Some of these skip innumerable steps such as audio, video, and progress -- which displays a progress bar! There is even an element, Canvas, that involves a 2D drawing API allowing the user to draw from the webpage, and can be used to display graph/ics. Historically HTML contains elements such as body, big, and small. These elements concern themselves with style have been implicitly phased out. This is because html's modern purpose is to define the content of a webpage - not to be the sole language of a webpage. CSS is the most common styling language used for webpages at current.</p>
