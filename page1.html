          I must admit you were right about how much people coast without realizing it. Get on the bike in the driveway, get moving, COAST while looking both ways...drift up to stop signs, standing to stretch and check traffic, COASTING... I went with plain pedals, no clips or straps the first couple of 25 mile rides so that when I did something stupid I didn't get lifted off the saddle, and I had less to think about in traffic, approaching stop signs. I'm much more comfortable now, and have put my clipless pedals back on.

Initially I stuck to flat areas around here. This past weekend I rode quite a bit in northern lower Michigan, with continuous rolling hills, some quite steep, but none very long. It's fun, almost a game, plotting stategy about how fast I can spin downhill, whether I think in advance that I can get up the next hill seated. It's probably all in my head, but it does seem that I'm more aware of the pedals moving in circles, and to what extent my legs are with them. I can see how riding a fixed gear in the snow would be a lot of fun

          I have so much fun riding the track bike that it is frustrating that I can't convince riders to spend more time on a fixed gear. The fixed gear builds a wonderful sense of oneness with the bike that can't be duplicated with a freewheel bike. I am absolutely convinced that the fixed gear is better than a freewheel, not only in developing and maintaining the pedal stroke, but also in developing strength and power. I particularly like the fixed gear in biathlon competitions (usually 5K runs, 30K bike rides, and a final 5K run), because the fixed gear allows me to get more quickly into a smooth, economical pedal stroke, something which can be difficult to achieve after a hard run.

        Fixed-gear is a totally new dimension in riding. I really feel like I'm part of the bike. It's also a brand-new challange, too. I love to go up hills as long as they're not too steep. Going downhill, however, is also more of a challange. One time on a club ride I unclipped from my pedals and let'r rip! That was very scary, sitting on my seat at 35+mph with my legs flailed outward. One wrong move and it would've been curtains for me! In many situations they demand total concentration. After the same ride (40 miles) my legs felt like spagetti strands. I sure got a workout and it was very satisfying because I felt that I really accomplished something.
