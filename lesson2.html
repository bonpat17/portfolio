          After WWII, the city of Fiume came under Communist control as part of Yugoslavia. The Aerospider remained hidden within the Jankovits’ garage until one brother, Gino Jankovits, was accused of collaborating with the Nazis. With the loss of the family business and property through seizure by the new Communist government under Tito and facing execution, the Jankovits realised escaping the country was the only solution to survival. But how would they escape the country? While sources are unclear as to the actions of Oscar Jankovits and how he survived, his brother Gino was set on a plan - he would save the Aerospider and use it for a do-or-die run to freedom.

          So under the cover of darkness on Christmas Eve 1946, Gino unearthed the Aerospider from the Fiume garage and woke it from its wartime slumber. After loading it up, Gino set a course for Italy, buried his foot to the floor and made a break for the border. As he approached the barrier gate at high speed, Communist soldiers alarmed by the Aerospider’s sleek and rapidly approaching silhouette opened fire. Bullets ripped through the rear tyres and hit the rear bodywork but thanks to the Aerospider’s low profile and speed, Gino was unharmed and with expert driving skill, rocketed past the border guards by driving underneath the barrier gate to Italy and freedom. Sadly, to finance their life in Italy, the Jankovits were forced to sell the Aerospider to an Anglo-American solider based in Italy and it disappeared for 20 years until it was found once again in the United Kingdom.

      Since its discovery, it was returned to Italy for a full restoration and has since made several appearances at car shows including the Concorso D’Eleganza Villa d’Este, Salon Privé and Goodwood Festival of Speed. It is now currently on display at the Auto & Technik Museum in Sinsheim, Germany, but just for this weekend, it made an appearance at the London Classic Car Show in full working order.
