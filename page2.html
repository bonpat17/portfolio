        <h2>
          I must admit you were right about how much people coast without realizing it. Get on the bike in the driveway, get moving, COAST while looking both ways...drift up to stop signs, standing to stretch and check traffic, COASTING... I went with plain pedals, no clips or straps the first couple of 25 mile rides so that when I did something stupid I didn't get lifted off the saddle, and I had less to think about in traffic, approaching stop signs. I'm much more comfortable now, and have put my clipless pedals back on.

Initially I stuck to flat areas around here. This past weekend I rode quite a bit in northern lower Michigan, with continuous rolling hills, some quite steep, but none very long. It's fun, almost a game, plotting stategy about how fast I can spin downhill, whether I think in advance that I can get up the next hill seated. It's probably all in my head, but it does seem that I'm more aware of the pedals moving in circles, and to what extent my legs are with them. I can see how riding a fixed gear in the snow would be a lot of fun
